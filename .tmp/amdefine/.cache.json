It will automatically insert the above snippet in each .js file loaded\nby Node.\n\n**Warning**: you should only use this if you are creating an application that\nis consuming AMD style defined()'d modules that are distributed via npm and want\nto run that code in Node.\n\nFor library code where you are not sure if it will be used by others in Node or\nin the browser, then explicitly depending on amdefine and placing the code\nsnippet above is suggested path, instead of using `amdefine/intercept`. The\nintercept module affects all .js files loaded in the Node app, and it is\ninconsiderate to modify global state like that unless you are also controlling\nthe top level app.\n\n#### Why distribute AMD-style nodes via npm?\n\nnpm has a lot of weaknesses for front-end use (installed layout is not great,\nshould have better support for the `baseUrl + moduleID + '.js' style of loading,\nsingle file JS installs), but some people want a JS package manager and are\nwilling to live with those constraints. If that is you, but still want to author\nin AMD style modules to get dynamic require([]), better direct source usage and\npowerful loader plugin support in the browser, then this tool can help.\n\n#### amdefine/intercept usage\n\nJust require it in your top level app module (for example index.js, server.js):\n\n```javascript\nrequire('amdefine/intercept');\n```\n\nThe module does not return a value, so no need to assign the result to a local\nvariable.\n\nThen just require() code as you normally would with Node's require(). Any .js\nloaded after the intercept require will have the amdefine check injected in\nthe .js source as it is loaded. It does not modify the source on disk, just\nprepends some content to the text of the module as it is loaded by Node.\n\n#### How amdefine/intercept works\n\nIt overrides the `Module._extensions['.js']` in Node to automatically prepend\nthe amdefine snippet above. So, it will affect any .js file loaded by your\napp.\n\n## define() usage\n\nIt is best if you use the anonymous forms of define() in your module:\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    var dependency = require('dependency');\n});\n```\n\nor\n\n```javascript\ndefine(['dependency'], function (dependency) {\n\n});\n```\n\n## RequireJS optimizer integration. <a name=\"optimizer\"></name>\n\nVersion 1.0.3 of the [RequireJS optimizer](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html)\nwill have support for stripping the `if (typeof define !== 'function')` check\nmentioned above, so you can include this snippet for code that runs in the\nbrowser, but avoid taking the cost of the if() statement once the code is\noptimized for deployment.\n\n## Node 0.4 Support\n\nIf you want to support Node 0.4, then add `require` as the second parameter to amdefine:\n\n```javascript\n//Only if you want Node 0.4.
