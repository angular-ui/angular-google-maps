grunt\nGrunt is a task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects.\n\n_Grunt is currently in beta. While I'm already using it on multiple projects, it might have a minor issue or two. And things might change before its final release, based on your feedback. Please try it out in a project, and [make suggestions][issues] or [report bugs][issues]!_\n\n## Getting started <a name=\"getting-started\" href=\"#getting-started\" title=\"Link to this section\">⚑</a>\nBe sure to read the [getting started guide](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md), which is a complete guide to configuring grunt for your project. In addition, check out the [example gruntfiles](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/example_gruntfiles.md) which highlight a number of fairly common configurations.\n\n## Built-in tasks <a name=\"built-in-tasks\" href=\"#built-in-tasks\" title=\"Link to this section\">⚑</a>\nAs of now, grunt has the following predefined tasks that you can use in your project:\n\n* [concat](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_concat.md) - Concatenate files.\n* [init](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_init.md) - Generate project scaffolding from a predefined template.\n* [lint](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_lint.md) - Validate files with [JSHint][jshint].\n* [min](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_min.md) - Minify files with [UglifyJS][uglify].\n* [qunit](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_qunit.md) - Run [QUnit][qunit] unit tests in a headless [PhantomJS][phantom] instance.\n* [server](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_server.md) - Start a static web server.\n* test - Run unit tests with [nodeunit][nodeunit].\n* watch - Run predefined tasks whenever watched files change.\n\n_(More documentation forthcoming)_\n\n## Custom tasks <a name=\"custom-tasks\" href=\"#custom-tasks\" title=\"Link to this section\">⚑</a>\nIn addition to the built-in tasks, you can create your own tasks. Don't like a built-in task's default behavior? Override it. Check out the [grunt API documentation](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/api.md) and the [built-in tasks source](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/tasks) for everything you need to know about creating custom tasks.\n\n## Documentation <a name=\"documentation\" href=\"#documentation\" title=\"Link to this section\">⚑</a>\nTake a look at the [documentation table of contents][docs] for all the things.\n\n## Why does grunt exist? <a name=\"why-does-grunt-exist\" href=\"#why-does-grunt-exist\" title=\"Link to this section\">⚑</a>\nDoing all this stuff manually is a total pain, and building all this stuff into a gigantic Makefile / Jakefile / Cakefile / Rakefile / ?akefile that's maintained across all my projects was also becoming a total pain. Since I always found myself performing the same tasks over and over again, for every project, it made sense to build a task-based build tool.\n\nBeing primarily a JavaScript developer, I decided to use [Node.js][node] and [npm][npm] because the dependencies I most care about ([JSHint][jshint] and [UglifyJS][uglify]) were already npm modules. That being said, while Node.js was designed to support highly-concurrent asynchronous-IO-driven web servers, it was clearly NOT designed to make command-line build tools. But none of that matters, because grunt works. Just install it and see.\n\n## Installing grunt <a name=\"installing-grunt\" href=\"#installing-grunt\" title=\"Link to this section\">⚑</a>\n\nGrunt is available as an [npm][npm] module. If you install grunt globally via `npm install -g grunt`, it will be available for use in all of your projects. Once grunt has been installed, you can type `grunt --help` at the command line for more information. And if you want to see grunt \"grunt\" itself, cd into grunt's directory and type `grunt`\n\n_Note: in Windows, you may need to run grunt as `grunt.cmd`. See the [FAQ](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/faq.md) for more Windows-specific information._\n\nFor projects already using grunt, you're done. Otherwise, if you're adding grunt to an existing project or starting from scratch, check out the [getting started guide](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md), which is a complete guide to configuring grunt for your project.\n\n## Release History <a name=\"release-history\" href=\"#release-history\" title=\"Link to this section\">⚑</a>\n_(Until v1.0.0, this will only be updated when major or breaking changes are made)_\n\n* 2012/06/25 - v0.3.10 - Updating a few dependencies to work with node 0.8.x (0.6.x should still work).\n* 2012/04/18 - v0.3.9 - The min task (via the uglify helper) now appends a semicolon to the end of the generated source.\n* 2012/04/06 - v0.3.8 - Init template tweaks. Anchor links added to docs, along with grunt-internal docs task to generate them. The watch task now supports multiple targets with separate wildcards and tasks. Locally-installed grunt will override global grunt even when run from global \"grunt\" script.\n* 2012/04/01 - v0.3.7 - Tweaked the behavior of the init template `exports.warnOn` property and added more init template documentation. Fixed duplicate PhantomJS debug output in qunit task. Added useful nodeunit and qunit comments into init template generated test .js files.\n* 2012/03/28 - v0.3.6 - Fixed a `--help` screen issue, a few grunt plugin related issues, and attempted to improve the overall grunt plugin docs and API.\n* 2012/03/27 - v0.3.5 - Fixed a handful of weird Windows issues. Changed default m/d/yyyy dates to yyyy-mm-dd ISO 8601. Fixed some init task bugs, docs errata, and added a lot more content to the init task docs.\n* 2012/03/26 - v0.3.3 - Added a \"gruntfile\" init template. Create a basic gruntfile in seconds with `grunt init:gruntfile`. A few other minor fixes.\n* 2012/03/25 - v0.3.2 - Init tasks can now specify a file matching wildcard for the initial \"files exist\" warning. The jQuery init template now has jQuery 1.7.2. Fixed a bug in the `task.expand*` methods.\n* 2012/03/25 - v0.3.1 - Added a few methods. Substantially reworked the init task and templates.\n* 2012/03/23 - v0.3.0 - Too many changes to list. But in brief: completely reorganized the API, removed all globals, added docs and examples for nearly everything, built a preliminary plugin system (that still needs to be tested). PLEASE RTFM OK? THX U.\n* 2012/02/03 - v0.2.14 - Added a server task (which starts a static webserver for your tasks). The qunit task now uses PhantomJS instead of Zombie.js (4768 of 4971 jQuery unit test pass, neat), and supports both file wildcards as well as http:// or https:// urls. (static webserver, anyone?). Grunt should no longer \"hang\" when done.\n* 2012/01/29 - v0.2.5 - Added a \"qunit\" task as well as an init \"jquery\" template (as of now, there are also \"node\" and \"commonjs\" init templates).\n* 2012/01/22 - v0.2.1 - Removed handlebars, templates are universally handled by underscore now. Changed init task template tags from <% %> to {% %}. Banners beginning with /*! will no longer be stripped.\n* 2012/01/22 - v0.2.0 - Added \"init\" task with a sample template, reworked a lot of code. Hopefully it's backwards-compatible.\n* 2012/01/11 - v0.1.0 - Initial release.\n\n## License <a name=\"license\" href=\"#license\" title=\"Link to this section\">⚑</a>\nCopyright (c) 2012 \"Cowboy\" Ben Alman  \nLicensed under the MIT license.  \n<http://benalman.com/about/license/>\n\n\n[docs]: /cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/toc.md\n[docs-init]: /cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_init.md\n[issues]: /cowboy/grunt/issues\n\n[node]: http://nodejs.org/\n[npm]: http://npmjs.org/\n[jshint]: http://www.jshint.com/\n[uglify]: https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/\n[nodeunit]: https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit\n[qunit]: http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit\n[phantom]: http://www.phantomjs.org/\n","_id":"grunt@0.3.10","dist":{"shasum":"8d58789e3eb76db4328d9b1c69b50e0cdaa46ee1","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/grunt/-/grunt-0.3.10.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"cowboy","email":"cowboy@rj3.net"}],"directories":{}},"0.3.11":{"name":"grunt","description":"A task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects.","version":"0.3.11","author":{"name":"\"Cowboy\" Ben Alman","url":"http://benalman.com/"},"homepage":"http://github.com/cowboy/grunt","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/cowboy/grunt.git"},"bugs":{"url":"http://github.com/cowboy/grunt/issues"},"licenses":[{"type":"MIT","url":"http://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/LICENSE-MIT"}],"main":"lib/grunt","bin":{"grunt":"bin/grunt"},"scripts":{"test":"grunt test"},"engines":{"node":">= 0.6.0"},"preferGlobal":true,"keywords":["async","cli","minify","uglify","build","underscore","unit","test","qunit","nodeunit","server","init","scaffold","make","jake","tool"],"dependencies":{"async":"~0.1.18","colors":"~0.6.0","connect":"~2.3.4","dateformat":"1.0.2-1.2.3","glob-whatev":"~0.1.4","hooker":"~0.2.3","jshint":"~0.5.9","nodeunit":"~0.6.4","nopt":"~1.0.10","prompt":"~0.1.12","semver":"~1.0.13","uglify-js":"~1.0.7","underscore":"~1.2.4","underscore.string":"~2.1.1","temporary":"~0.0.4","gzip-js":"~0.3.1"},"devDependencies":{},"readme":"# grunt\nGrunt is a task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects.\n\n_Grunt is currently in beta.

While I'm already using it on multiple projects, it might have a minor issue or two. And things might change before its final release, based on your feedback. Please try it out in a project, and [make suggestions][issues] or [report bugs][issues]!_\n\n## Getting started\nBe sure to read the [getting started guide](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md), which is a complete guide to configuring grunt for your project. In addition, check out the [example gruntfiles](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/example_gruntfiles.md) which highlight a number of fairly common configurations.\n\n## Built-in tasks\nAs of now, grunt has the following predefined tasks that you can use in your project:\n\n* [concat](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_concat.md) - Concatenate files.\n* [init](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_init.md) - Generate project scaffolding from a predefined template.\n* [lint](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_lint.md) - Validate files with [JSHint][jshint].\n* [min](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_min.md) - Minify files with [UglifyJS][uglify].\n* [qunit](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_qunit.md) - Run [QUnit][qunit] unit tests in a headless [PhantomJS][phantom] instance.\n* [server](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_server.md) - Start a static web server.\n* test - Run unit tests with [nodeunit][nodeunit].\n* watch - Run predefined tasks whenever watched files change.\n\n_(More documentation forthcoming)_\n\n## Custom tasks\nIn addition to the built-in tasks, you can create your own tasks. Don't like a built-in task's default behavior? Override it. Check out the [grunt API documentation](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/api.md) and the [built-in tasks source](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/tasks) for everything you need to know about creating custom tasks.\n\n## Documentation\nTake a look at the [documentation table of contents][docs] for all the things.\n\n## Why does grunt exist?\nDoing all this stuff manually is a total pain, and building all this stuff into a gigantic Makefile / Jakefile / Cakefile / Rakefile / ?akefile that's maintained across all my projects was also becoming a total pain. Since I always found myself performing the same tasks over and over again, for every project, it made sense to build a task-based build tool.\n\nBeing primarily a JavaScript developer, I decided to use [Node.js][node] and [npm][npm] because the dependencies I most care about ([JSHint][jshint] and [UglifyJS][uglify]) were already npm modules. That being said, while Node.js was designed to support highly-concurrent asynchronous-IO-driven web servers, it was clearly NOT designed to make command-line build tools. But none of that matters, because grunt works. Just install it and see.\n\n## Installing grunt\n\nGrunt is available as an [npm][npm] module. If you install grunt globally via `npm install -g grunt`, it will be available for use in all of your projects. Once grunt has been installed, you can type `grunt --help` at the command line for more information. And if you want to see grunt \"grunt\" itself, cd into grunt's directory and type `grunt`\n\n_Note: in Windows, you may need to run grunt as `grunt.cmd`. See the [FAQ](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/faq.md) for more Windows-specific information._\n\nFor projects already using grunt, you're done. Otherwise, if you're adding grunt to an existing project or starting from scratch, check out the [getting started guide](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md), which is a complete guide to configuring grunt for your project.\n\n## Release History\n_(Until v1.0.0, this will only be updated when major or breaking changes are made)_\n\n* 2012/08/27 - v0.3.13 - Fixed Node.js 0.8.x path.existsSync warning. Updated connect, nodeunit, uglify-js deps to latest. Updated docs. Grunt plugins generated with init:gruntplugin no longer include grunt as a dependency. Added preliminary support for \"collection\" plugins.\n* 2012/07/30 - v0.3.12 - Fixing a bug in node 0.8.x where utils.spawn would terminate before receiving all child stdout.\n* 2012/06/25 - v0.3.10 - Updating a few dependencies to work with node 0.8.x (0.6.x should still work).\n* 2012/04/18 - v0.3.9 - The min task (via the uglify helper) now appends a semicolon to the end of the generated source.\n* 2012/04/06 - v0.3.8 - Init template tweaks. Anchor links added to docs, along with grunt-internal docs task to generate them. The watch task now supports multiple targets with separate wildcards and tasks. Locally-installed grunt will override global grunt even when run from global \"grunt\" script.\n* 2012/04/01 - v0.3.7 - Tweaked the behavior of the init template `exports.warnOn` property and added more init template documentation. Fixed duplicate PhantomJS debug output in qunit task. Added useful nodeunit and qunit comments into init template generated test .js files.\n* 2012/03/28 - v0.3.6 - Fixed a `--help` screen issue, a few grunt plugin related issues, and attempted to improve the overall grunt plugin docs and API.\n* 2012/03/27 - v0.3.5 - Fixed a handful of weird Windows issues. Changed default m/d/yyyy dates to yyyy-mm-dd ISO 8601. Fixed some init task bugs, docs errata, and added a lot more content to the init task docs.\n* 2012/03/26 - v0.3.3 - Added a \"gruntfile\" init template. Create a basic gruntfile in seconds with `grunt init:gruntfile`. A few other minor fixes.\n* 2012/03/25 - v0.3.2 - Init tasks can now specify a file matching wildcard for the initial \"files exist\" warning. The jQuery init template now has jQuery 1.7.2. Fixed a bug in the `task.expand*` methods.\n* 2012/03/25 - v0.3.1 - Added a few methods. Substantially reworked the init task and templates.\n* 2012/03/23 - v0.3.0 - Too many changes to list. But in brief: completely reorganized the API, removed all globals, added docs and examples for nearly everything, built a preliminary plugin system (that still needs to be tested). PLEASE RTFM OK? THX U.\n* 2012/02/03 - v0.2.14 - Added a server task (which starts a static webserver for your tasks). The qunit task now uses PhantomJS instead of Zombie.js (4768 of 4971 jQuery unit test pass, neat), and supports both file wildcards as well as http:// or https:// urls. (static webserver, anyone?). Grunt should no longer \"hang\" when done.\n* 2012/01/29 - v0.2.5 - Added a \"qunit\" task as well as an init \"jquery\" template (as of now, there are also \"node\" and \"commonjs\" init templates).\n* 2012/01/22 - v0.2.1 - Removed handlebars, templates are universally handled by underscore now. Changed init task template tags from <% %> to {% %}. Banners beginning with /*! will no longer be stripped.\n* 2012/01/22 - v0.2.0 - Added \"init\" task with a sample template, reworked a lot of code. Hopefully it's backwards-compatible.\n* 2012/01/11 - v0.1.0 - Initial release.\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2012 \"Cowboy\" Ben Alman  \nLicensed under the MIT license.  \n<http://benalman.com/about/license/>\n\n\n[docs]: /cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/toc.md\n[docs-init]: /cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_init.md\n[issues]: /cowboy/grunt/issues\n\n[node]: http://nodejs.org/\n[npm]: http://npmjs.org/\n[jshint]: http://www.jshint.com/\n[uglify]: https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/\n[nodeunit]: https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit\n[qunit]: http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit\n[phantom]: http://www.phantomjs.org/\n","_id":"grunt@0.3.13","dist":{"shasum":"226033f72d45bb4fb06b59de6973be20a41c2017","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/grunt/-/grunt-0.3.13.tgz"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.49","_npmUser":{"name":"cowboy","email":"cowboy@rj3.net"},"maintainers":[{"name":"cowboy","email":"cowboy@rj3.net"}],"directories":{}},"0.3.14":{"name":"grunt","description":"A task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects.","version":"0.3.14","author":{"name":"\"Cowboy\" Ben Alman","url":"http://benalman.com/"},"homepage":"http://github.com/cowboy/grunt","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/cowboy/grunt.git"},"bugs":{"url":"http://github.com/cowboy/grunt/issues"},"licenses":[{"type":"MIT","url":"http://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/LICENSE-MIT"}],"main":"lib/grunt","bin":{"grunt":"bin/grunt"},"scripts":{"test":"grunt test"},"engines":{"node":">= 0.6.0"},"preferGlobal":true,"keywords":["async","cli","minify","uglify","build","underscore","unit","test","qunit","nodeunit","server","init","scaffold","make","jake","tool"],"dependencies":{"async":"~0.1.18","colors":"~0.6.0","connect":"~2.4.4","dateformat":"1.0.2-1.2.3","glob-whatev":"~0.1.4","hooker":"~0.2.3","jshint":"~0.5.9","nodeunit":"~0.7.4","nopt":"~1.0.10","prompt":"~0.1.12","semver":"~1.0.13","uglify-js":"~1.3.3","underscore":"~1.2.4","underscore.string":"~2.1.1","temporary":"~0.0.4","gzip-js":"~0.3.1"},"devDependencies":{},"readme":"# grunt\nGrunt is a task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects.\n\n_Grunt is currently in beta.

But in brief: completely reorganized the API, removed all globals, added docs and examples for nearly everything, built a preliminary plugin system (that still needs to be tested). PLEASE RTFM OK? THX U.\n* 2012/02/03 - v0.2.14 - Added a server task (which starts a static webserver for your tasks). The qunit task now uses PhantomJS instead of Zombie.js (4768 of 4971 jQuery unit test pass, neat), and supports both file wildcards as well as http:// or https:// urls. (static webserver, anyone?). Grunt should no longer \"hang\" when done.\n* 2012/01/29 - v0.2.5 - Added a \"qunit\" task as well as an init \"jquery\" template (as of now, there are also \"node\" and \"commonjs\" init templates).\n* 2012/01/22 - v0.2.1 - Removed handlebars, templates are universally handled by underscore now. Changed init task template tags from <% %> to {% %}. Banners beginning with /*! will no longer be stripped.\n* 2012/01/22 - v0.2.0 - Added \"init\" task with a sample template, reworked a lot of code. Hopefully it's backwards-compatible.\n* 2012/01/11 - v0.1.0 - Initial release.\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2012 \"Cowboy\" Ben Alman  \nLicensed under the MIT license.  \n<http://benalman.com/about/license/>\n\n\n[docs]: /cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/toc.md\n[docs-init]: /cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_init.md\n[issues]: /cowboy/grunt/issues\n\n[node]: http://nodejs.org/\n[npm]: http://npmjs.org/\n[jshint]: http://www.jshint.com/\n[uglify]: https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/\n[nodeunit]: https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit\n[qunit]: http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit\n[phantom]: http://www.phantomjs.org/\n","_id":"grunt@0.3.15","dist":{"shasum":"8e8e323631fb78ad2d4ff5477da5f1b0261fb288","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/grunt/-/grunt-0.3.15.tgz"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.59","_npmUser":{"name":"cowboy","email":"cowboy@rj3.net"},"maintainers":[{"name":"cowboy","email":"cowboy@rj3.net"}],"directories":{}},"0.3.16":{"name":"grunt","description":"A task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects.","version":"0.3.16","author":{"name":"\"Cowboy\" Ben Alman","url":"http://benalman.com/"},"homepage":"http://github.com/gruntjs/grunt","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/gruntjs/grunt.git"},"bugs":{"url":"http://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues"},"licenses":[{"type":"MIT","url":"http://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/LICENSE-MIT"}],"main":"lib/grunt","bin":{"grunt":"bin/grunt"},"scripts":{"test":"grunt test"},"engines":{"node":">= 0.6.0"},"preferGlobal":true,"keywords":["async","cli","minify","uglify","build","underscore","unit","test","qunit","nodeunit","server","init","scaffold","make","jake","tool"],"dependencies":{"async":"~0.1.18","colors":"~0.6.0","connect":"~2.4.4","dateformat":"1.0.2-1.2.3","glob-whatev":"~0.1.4","hooker":"~0.2.3","jshint":"~0.5.9","nodeunit":"~0.7.4","nopt":"~1.0.10","prompt":"~0.1.12","semver":"~1.0.13","uglify-js":"~1.3.3","underscore":"~1.2.4","underscore.string":"~2.1.1","temporary":"~0.0.4","gzip-js":"~0.3.1"},"devDependencies":{},"readme":"# grunt\nGrunt is a task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects.\n\n_Grunt is currently in beta. While I'm already using it on multiple projects, it might have a minor issue or two. And things might change before its final release, based on your feedback. Please try it out in a project, and [make suggestions][issues] or [report bugs][issues]!_\n\n## Getting started\nBe sure to read the [getting started guide](/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md), which is a complete guide to configuring grunt for your project. In addition, check out the [example gruntfiles](/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/example_gruntfiles.md) which highlight a number of fairly common configurations.\n\n## Built-in tasks\nAs of now, grunt has the following predefined tasks that you can use in your project:\n\n* [concat](/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_concat.md) - Concatenate files.\n* [init](/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_init.md) - Generate project scaffolding from a predefined template.\n* [lint](/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_lint.md) - Validate files with [JSHint][jshint].\n* [min](/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_min.md) - Minify files with [UglifyJS][uglify].\n* [qunit](/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_qunit.md) - Run [QUnit][qunit] unit tests in a headless [PhantomJS][phantom] instance.\n* [server](/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_server.md) - Start a static web server.\n* test - Run unit tests with [nodeunit][nodeunit].\n* watch - Run predefined tasks whenever watched files change.\n\n_(More documentation forthcoming)_\n\n## Custom tasks\nIn addition to the built-in tasks, you can create your own tasks. Don't like a built-in task's default behavior? Override it. Check out the [grunt API documentation](/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/api.md) and the [built-in tasks source](/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/tasks) for everything you need to know about creating custom tasks.\n\n## Documentation\nTake a look at the [documentation table of contents][docs] for all the things.\n\n## Why does grunt exist?\nDoing all this stuff manually is a total pain, and building all this stuff into a gigantic Makefile / Jakefile / Cakefile / Rakefile / ?akefile that's maintained across all my projects was also becoming a total pain. Since I always found myself performing the same tasks over and over again, for every project, it made sense to build a task-based build tool.\n\nBeing primarily a JavaScript developer, I decided to use [Node.js][node] and [npm][npm] because the dependencies I most care about ([JSHint][jshint] and [UglifyJS][uglify]) were already npm modules. That being said, while Node.js was designed to support highly-concurrent asynchronous-IO-driven web servers, it was clearly NOT designed to make command-line build tools. But none of that matters, because grunt works. Just install it and see.\n\n## Installing grunt\n\nGrunt is available as an [npm][npm] module. If you install grunt globally via `npm install -g grunt`, it will be available for use in all of your projects. Once grunt has been installed, you can type `grunt --help` at the command line for more information. And if you want to see grunt \"grunt\" itself, cd into grunt's directory and type `grunt`\n\n_Note: in Windows, you may need to run grunt as `grunt.cmd`. See the [FAQ](/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/faq.md) for more Windows-specific information._\n\nFor projects already using grunt, you're done. Otherwise, if you're adding grunt to an existing project or starting from scratch, check out the [getting started guide](/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md), which is a complete guide to configuring grunt for your project.\n\n## Release History\n_(Until v1.0.0, this will only be updated when major or breaking changes are made)_\n\n* 2012/10/01 - v0.3.16 - Updated URLs to reflect new website and source location. Tweaks to the \"jquery\" and \"commonjs\" init templates. Fixed an issue when exiting due to warning or fatal error.\n* 2012/09/04 - v0.3.15 - Fixing a minor problem with renaming multi tasks.\n* 2012/08/29 - v0.3.14 - Grunt plugins lacking package.json keywords should work again.\n* 2012/08/27 - v0.3.13 - Fixed Node.js 0.8.x path.existsSync warning. Updated connect, nodeunit, uglify-js deps to latest. Updated docs. Grunt plugins generated with init:gruntplugin no longer include grunt as a dependency. Added preliminary support for \"collection\" plugins.\n* 2012/07/30 - v0.3.12 - Fixing a bug in node 0.8.x where utils.spawn would terminate before receiving all child stdout.\n* 2012/06/25 - v0.3.10 - Updating a few dependencies to work with node 0.8.x (0.6.x should still work).\n* 2012/04/18 - v0.3.9 - The min task (via the uglify helper) now appends a semicolon to the end of the generated source.\n* 2012/04/06 - v0.3.8 - Init template tweaks. Anchor links added to docs, along with grunt-internal docs task to generate them. The watch task now supports multiple targets with separate wildcards and tasks. Locally-installed grunt will override global grunt even when run from global \"grunt\" script.\n* 2012/04/01 - v0.3.7 - Tweaked the behavior of the init template `exports.warnOn` property and added more init template documentation. Fixed duplicate PhantomJS debug output in qunit task. Added useful nodeunit and qunit comments into init template generated test .js files.\n* 2012/03/28 - v0.3.6 - Fixed a `--help` screen issue, a few grunt plugin related issues, and attempted to improve the overall grunt plugin docs and API.\n* 2012/03/27 - v0.3.5 - Fixed a handful of weird Windows issues. Changed default m/d/yyyy dates to yyyy-mm-dd ISO 8601. Fixed some init task bugs, docs errata, and added a lot more content to the init task docs.\n* 2012/03/26 - v0.3.3 - Added a \"gruntfile\" init template. Create a basic gruntfile in seconds with `grunt init:gruntfile`. A few other minor fixes.\n* 2012/03/25 - v0.3.2 - Init tasks can now specify a file matching wildcard for the initial \"files exist\" warning. The jQuery init template now has jQuery 1.7.2.

grunt\nGrunt is a task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects.\n\n_Grunt is currently in beta. While I'm already using it on multiple projects, it might have a minor issue or two. And things might change before its final release, based on your feedback. Please try it out in a project, and [make suggestions][issues] or [report bugs][issues]!_\n\n## Getting started\nBe sure to read the [getting started guide](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md), which is a complete guide to configuring grunt for your project. In addition, check out the [example gruntfiles](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/example_gruntfiles.md) which highlight a number of fairly common configurations.\n\n## Built-in tasks\nAs of now, grunt has the following predefined tasks that you can use in your project:\n\n* [concat](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_concat.md) - Concatenate files.\n* [init](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_init.md) - Generate project scaffolding from a predefined template.\n* [lint](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_lint.md) - Validate files with [JSHint][jshint].\n* [min](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_min.md) - Minify files with [UglifyJS][uglify].\n* [qunit](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_qunit.md) - Run [QUnit][qunit] unit tests in a headless [PhantomJS][phantom] instance.\n* [server](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_server.md) - Start a static web server.\n* test - Run unit tests with [nodeunit][nodeunit].\n* watch - Run predefined tasks whenever watched files change.\n\n_(More documentation forthcoming)_\n\n## Custom tasks\nIn addition to the built-in tasks, you can create your own tasks. Don't like a built-in task's default behavior? Override it. Check out the [grunt API documentation](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/api.md) and the [built-in tasks source](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/tasks) for everything you need to know about creating custom tasks.\n\n## Documentation\nTake a look at the [documentation table of contents][docs] for all the things.\n\n## Why does grunt exist?\nDoing all this stuff manually is a total pain, and building all this stuff into a gigantic Makefile / Jakefile / Cakefile / Rakefile / ?akefile that's maintained across all my projects was also becoming a total pain. Since I always found myself performing the same tasks over and over again, for every project, it made sense to build a task-based build tool.\n\nBeing primarily a JavaScript developer, I decided to use [Node.js][node] and [npm][npm] because the dependencies I most care about ([JSHint][jshint] and [UglifyJS][uglify]) were already npm modules. That being said, while Node.js was designed to support highly-concurrent asynchronous-IO-driven web servers, it was clearly NOT designed to make command-line build tools. But none of that matters, because grunt works. Just install it and see.\n\n## Installing grunt\n\nGrunt is available as an [npm][npm] module. If you install grunt globally via `npm install -g grunt`, it will be available for use in all of your projects. Once grunt has been installed, you can type `grunt --help` at the command line for more information. And if you want to see grunt \"grunt\" itself, cd into grunt's directory and type `grunt`\n\n_Note: in Windows, you may need to run grunt as `grunt.cmd`. See the [FAQ](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/faq.md) for more Windows-specific information._\n\nFor projects already using grunt, you're done. Otherwise, if you're adding grunt to an existing project or starting from scratch, check out the [getting started guide](/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md), which is a complete guide to configuring grunt for your project.\n\n## Release History\n_(Until v1.0.0, this will only be updated when major or breaking changes are made)_\n\n* 2012/07/30 - v0.3.12 - Fixing a bug in node 0.8.x where utils.spawn would terminate before receiving all child stdout.\n* 2012/06/25 - v0.3.10 - Updating a few dependencies to work with node 0.8.x (0.6.x should still work).\n* 2012/04/18 - v0.3.9 - The min task (via the uglify helper) now appends a semicolon to the end of the generated source.\n* 2012/04/06 - v0.3.8 - Init template tweaks. Anchor links added to docs, along with grunt-internal docs task to generate them. The watch task now supports multiple targets with separate wildcards and tasks. Locally-installed grunt will override global grunt even when run from global \"grunt\" script.\n* 2012/04/01 - v0.3.7 - Tweaked the behavior of the init template `exports.warnOn` property and added more init template documentation. Fixed duplicate PhantomJS debug output in qunit task. Added useful nodeunit and qunit comments into init template generated test .js files.\n* 2012/03/28 - v0.3.6 - Fixed a `--help` screen issue, a few grunt plugin related issues, and attempted to improve the overall grunt plugin docs and API.\n* 2012/03/27 - v0.3.5 - Fixed a handful of weird Windows issues. Changed default m/d/yyyy dates to yyyy-mm-dd ISO 8601. Fixed some init task bugs, docs errata, and added a lot more content to the init task docs.\n* 2012/03/26 - v0.3.3 - Added a \"gruntfile\" init template. Create a basic gruntfile in seconds with `grunt init:gruntfile`. A few other minor fixes.\n* 2012/03/25 - v0.3.2 - Init tasks can now specify a file matching wildcard for the initial \"files exist\" warning. The jQuery init template now has jQuery 1.7.2. Fixed a bug in the `task.expand*` methods.\n* 2012/03/25 - v0.3.1 - Added a few methods. Substantially reworked the init task and templates.\n* 2012/03/23 - v0.3.0 - Too many changes to list. But in brief: completely reorganized the API, removed all globals, added docs and examples for nearly everything, built a preliminary plugin system (that still needs to be tested). PLEASE RTFM OK? THX U.\n* 2012/02/03 - v0.2.14 - Added a server task (which starts a static webserver for your tasks). The qunit task now uses PhantomJS instead of Zombie.js (4768 of 4971 jQuery unit test pass, neat), and supports both file wildcards as well as http:// or https:// urls. (static webserver, anyone?). Grunt should no longer \"hang\" when done.\n* 2012/01/29 - v0.2.5 - Added a \"qunit\" task as well as an init \"jquery\" template (as of now, there are also \"node\" and \"commonjs\" init templates).\n* 2012/01/22 - v0.2.1 - Removed handlebars, templates are universally handled by underscore now. Changed init task template tags from <% %> to {% %}. Banners beginning with /*! will no longer be stripped.\n* 2012/01/22 - v0.2.0 - Added \"init\" task with a sample template, reworked a lot of code. Hopefully it's backwards-compatible.\n* 2012/01/11 - v0.1.0 - Initial release.\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2012 \"Cowboy\" Ben Alman  \nLicensed under the MIT license.  \n<http://benalman.com/about/license/>\n\n\n[docs]: /cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/toc.md\n[docs-init]: /cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_init.md\n[issues]: /cowboy/grunt/issues\n\n[node]: http://nodejs.org/\n[npm]: http://npmjs.org/\n[jshint]: http://www.jshint.com/\n[uglify]: https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/\n[nodeunit]: https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit\n[qunit]: http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit\n[phantom]: http://www.phantomjs.org/\n","_id":"grunt@0.3.13-a","dist":{"shasum":"f9bb0b9e3af83fde4f2cb927b8540736610777e9","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/grunt/-/grunt-0.3.13a.tgz"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.49","_npmUser":{"name":"cowboy","email":"cowboy@rj3.net"},"maintainers":[{"name":"cowboy","email":"cowboy@rj3.net"}],"directories":{}},"0.4.0-a":{"name":"grunt","description":"A task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects.","version":"0.4.0-a","author":{"name":"\"Cowboy\" Ben Alman","url":"http://benalman.com/"},"homepage":"http://gruntjs.com/","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/gruntjs/grunt.git"},"bugs":{"url":"http://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues"},"licenses":[{"type":"MIT","url":"http://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/LICENSE-MIT"}],"main":"lib/grunt","scripts":{"test":"./node_modules/.bin/grunt test"},"engines":{"node":">= 0.8.0"},"keywords":["async","cli","minify","uglify","build","lodash","unit","test","qunit","nodeunit","server","init","scaffold","make","jake","tool"],"dependencies":{"async":"~0.1.22","coffee-script":"~1.3.3","colors":"~0.6.0-1","dateformat":"1.0.2-1.2.3","eventemitter2":"~0.4.9","glob":"~3.1.13","grunt-init":"0.1.0","hooker":"~0.2.3","iconv-lite":"~0.2.5","minimatch":"~0.2.6","nopt":"~1.0.10","rimraf":"~2.0.2","lodash":"~0.9.0","underscore.string":"~2.2.0rc","which":"~1.0.5","js-yaml":"~1.0.1"},"devDependencies":{"temporary":"~0.0.4","grunt-contrib-jshint":"~0.1.0","grunt-contrib-nodeunit":"~0.1.0","grunt-contrib-watch":"~0.1.0","grunt-cli":"~0.1.1"},"contributors":[{"name":"\"Cowboy\" Ben Alman","url":"http://benalman.com/"},{"name":"Kyle Robinson Young","url":"http://dontkry.com/"},{"name":"Tyler Kellen","url":"http://goingslowly.com"},{"name":"Sindre Sorhus","url":"http://sindresorhus.com"}],"readme":"# grunt [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt.png?branch=devel)](http://travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt)\nGrunt is a task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects.\n\n_Grunt is currently in beta.

Fixed some init task bugs, docs errata, and added a lot more content to the init task docs.\n* 2012/03/26 - v0.3.3 - Added a \"gruntfile\" init template. Create a basic Gruntfile in seconds with `grunt init:gruntfile`. A few other minor fixes.\n* 2012/03/25 - v0.3.2 - Init tasks can now specify a file matching wildcard for the initial \"files exist\" warning. The jQuery init template now has jQuery 1.7.2. Fixed a bug in the `task.expand*` methods.\n* 2012/03/25 - v0.3.1 - Added a few methods. Substantially reworked the init task and templates.\n* 2012/03/23 - v0.3.0 - Too many changes to list. But in brief: completely reorganized the API, removed all globals, added docs and examples for nearly everything, built a preliminary plugin system (that still needs to be tested). PLEASE RTFM OK? THX U.\n* 2012/02/03 - v0.2.14 - Added a server task (which starts a static webserver for your tasks). The qunit task now uses PhantomJS instead of Zombie.js (4768 of 4971 jQuery unit test pass, neat), and supports both file wildcards as well as http:// or https:// urls. (static webserver, anyone?). Grunt should no longer \"hang\" when done.\n* 2012/01/29 - v0.2.5 - Added a \"qunit\" task as well as an init \"jquery\" template (as of now, there are also \"node\" and \"commonjs\" init templates).\n* 2012/01/22 - v0.2.1 - Removed handlebars, templates are universally handled by underscore now. Changed init task template tags from <% %> to {% %}. Banners beginning with /*! will no longer be stripped.\n* 2012/01/22 - v0.2.0 - Added \"init\" task with a sample template, reworked a lot of code. Hopefully it's backwards-compatible.\n* 2012/01/11 - v0.1.0 - Initial release.\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2012 \"Cowboy\" Ben Alman  \nLicensed under the MIT license.  \n<https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/LICENSE-MIT>\n\n\n[docs]: /gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/toc.md\n[docs-init]: /gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_init.md\n[issues]: /gruntjs/grunt/issues\n\n[node]: http://nodejs.org/\n[npm]: http://npmjs.org/\n[jshint]: http://www.jshint.com/\n[uglify]: https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/\n[nodeunit]: https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit\n[qunit]: http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit\n[phantom]: http://www.phantomjs.org/\n","_id":"grunt@0.4.0-rc1","dist":{"shasum":"8d6cc1a2ad50345fae3fa8af82892f8095ded5de","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/grunt/-/grunt-0.4.0rc1.tgz"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.62","_npmUser":{"name":"cowboy","email":"cowboy@rj3.net"},"maintainers":[{"name":"cowboy","email":"cowboy@rj3.net"},{"name":"tkellen","email":"tyler@sleekcode.net"}],"directories":{}},"0.4.0-rc2":{"name":"grunt","description":"A task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects.","version":"0.4.0-rc2","author":{"name":"\"Cowboy\" Ben Alman","url":"http://benalman.com/"},"homepage":"http://gruntjs.com/","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/gruntjs/grunt.git"},"bugs":{"url":"http://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues"},"licenses":[{"type":"MIT","url":"http://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/LICENSE-MIT"}],"main":"lib/grunt","scripts":{"test":"./node_modules/.bin/grunt test"},"engines":{"node":">= 0.8.0"},"keywords":["async","cli","minify","uglify","build","lodash","unit","test","qunit","nodeunit","server","init","scaffold","make","jake","tool"],"dependencies":{"async":"~0.1.22","coffee-script":"~1.3.3","colors":"~0.6.0-1","dateformat":"1.0.2-1.2.3","eventemitter2":"~0.4.9","glob":"~3.1.13","hooker":"~0.2.3","iconv-lite":"~0.2.5","minimatch":"~0.2.6","nopt":"~1.0.10","rimraf":"~2.0.2","lodash":"~0.9.0","underscore.string":"~2.2.0rc","which":"~1.0.5","js-yaml":"~1.0.1"},"devDependencies":{"temporary":"~0.0.4","grunt-contrib-jshint":"~0.1.0","grunt-contrib-nodeunit":"~0.1.0","grunt-contrib-watch":"~0.1.0","grunt-cli":"~0.1.2"},"contributors":[{"name":"\"Cowboy\" Ben Alman","url":"http://benalman.com/"},{"name":"Kyle Robinson Young","url":"http://dontkry.com/"},{"name":"Tyler Kellen","url":"http://goingslowly.com"},{"name":"Sindre Sorhus","url":"http://sindresorhus.com"}],"readme":"# grunt [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt.png?branch=devel)](http://travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt)\nGrunt is a task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects.\n\n_Grunt is currently in beta. While I'm already using it on multiple projects, it might have a minor issue or two. And things might change before its final release, based on your feedback. Please try it out in a project, and [make suggestions][issues] or [report bugs][issues]!_\n\n## Getting started\nBe sure to read the [getting started guide](/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md), which is a complete guide to configuring grunt for your project. In addition, check out the [example Gruntfiles](/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/example_gruntfiles.md) which highlight a number of fairly common configurations.\n\n## Custom tasks\nIn addition to the built-in tasks, you can create your own tasks. Don't like a built-in task's default behavior? Override it. Check out the [grunt API documentation](/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/api.md) and the [built-in tasks source](/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/tasks) for everything you need to know about creating custom tasks.\n\n## Documentation\nTake a look at the [documentation table of contents][docs] for all the things.\n\n## Why does grunt exist?\nDoing all this stuff manually is a total pain, and building all this stuff into a gigantic Makefile / Jakefile / Cakefile / Rakefile / ?akefile that's maintained across all my projects was also becoming a total pain. Since I always found myself performing the same tasks over and over again, for every project, it made sense to build a task-based build tool.\n\nBeing primarily a JavaScript developer, I decided to use [Node.js][node] and [npm][npm] because the dependencies I most care about ([JSHint][jshint] and [UglifyJS][uglify]) were already npm modules. That being said, while Node.js was designed to support highly-concurrent asynchronous-IO-driven web servers, it was clearly NOT designed to make command-line build tools. But none of that matters, because grunt works. Just install it and see.\n\n## Installing grunt\n\nGrunt is available as an [npm][npm] module. If you install grunt globally via `npm install -g grunt`, it will be available for use in all of your projects. Once grunt has been installed, you can type `grunt --help` at the command line for more information. And if you want to see grunt \"grunt\" itself, cd into grunt's directory and type `grunt`\n\n_Note: in Windows, you may need to run grunt as `grunt.cmd`. See the [FAQ](/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/faq.md) for more Windows-specific information._\n\nFor projects already using grunt, you're done. Otherwise, if you're adding grunt to an existing project or starting from scratch, check out the [getting started guide](/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md), which is a complete guide to configuring grunt for your project.\n\n## Release History\n_(Until v1.0.0, this will only be updated when major or breaking changes are made)_\n\n* 2012/06/25 - v0.3.10 - Updating a few dependencies to work with node 0.8.x (0.6.x should still work).\n* 2012/04/18 - v0.3.9 - The min task (via the uglify helper) now appends a semicolon to the end of the generated source.\n* 2012/04/06 - v0.3.8 - Init template tweaks. Anchor links added to docs, along with grunt-internal docs task to generate them. The watch task now supports multiple targets with separate wildcards and tasks. Locally-installed grunt will override global grunt even when run from global \"grunt\" script.\n* 2012/04/01 - v0.3.7 - Tweaked the behavior of the init template `exports.warnOn` property and added more init template documentation. Fixed duplicate PhantomJS debug output in qunit task. Added useful nodeunit and qunit comments into init template generated test .js files.\n* 2012/03/28 - v0.3.6 - Fixed a `--help` screen issue, a few grunt plugin related issues, and attempted to improve the overall grunt plugin docs and API.\n* 2012/03/27 - v0.3.5 - Fixed a handful of weird Windows issues.

Anchor links added to docs, along with grunt-internal docs task to generate them. The watch task now supports multiple targets with separate wildcards and tasks. Locally-installed grunt will override global grunt even when run from global \"grunt\" script.\n* 2012/04/01 - v0.3.7 - Tweaked the behavior of the init template `exports.warnOn` property and added more init template documentation. Fixed duplicate PhantomJS debug output in qunit task. Added useful nodeunit and qunit comments into init template generated test .js files.\n* 2012/03/28 - v0.3.6 - Fixed a `--help` screen issue, a few grunt plugin related issues, and attempted to improve the overall grunt plugin docs and API.\n* 2012/03/27 - v0.3.5 - Fixed a handful of weird Windows issues. Changed default m/d/yyyy dates to yyyy-mm-dd ISO 8601. Fixed some init task bugs, docs errata, and added a lot more content to the init task docs.\n* 2012/03/26 - v0.3.3 - Added a \"gruntfile\" init template. Create a basic Gruntfile in seconds with `grunt init:gruntfile`. A few other minor fixes.\n* 2012/03/25 - v0.3.2 - Init tasks can now specify a file matching wildcard for the initial \"files exist\" warning. The jQuery init template now has jQuery 1.7.2. Fixed a bug in the `task.expand*` methods.\n* 2012/03/25 - v0.3.1 - Added a few methods. Substantially reworked the init task and templates.\n* 2012/03/23 - v0.3.0 - Too many changes to list. But in brief: completely reorganized the API, removed all globals, added docs and examples for nearly everything, built a preliminary plugin system (that still needs to be tested). PLEASE RTFM OK? THX U.\n* 2012/02/03 - v0.2.14 - Added a server task (which starts a static webserver for your tasks). The qunit task now uses PhantomJS instead of Zombie.js (4768 of 4971 jQuery unit test pass, neat), and supports both file wildcards as well as http:// or https:// urls. (static webserver, anyone?). Grunt should no longer \"hang\" when done.\n* 2012/01/29 - v0.2.5 - Added a \"qunit\" task as well as an init \"jquery\" template (as of now, there are also \"node\" and \"commonjs\" init templates).\n* 2012/01/22 - v0.2.1 - Removed handlebars, templates are universally handled by underscore now.

Hopefully it's backwards-compatible.\n* 2012/01/11 - v0.1.0 - Initial release.\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2012 \"Cowboy\" Ben Alman, contributors\nLicensed under the MIT license.  \n<https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/LICENSE-MIT>\n\n[node]: http://nodejs.org/\n[npm]: http://npmjs.org/\n[jshint]: http://www.jshint.com/\n[uglify]: https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/\n[nodeunit]: https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit\n[qunit]: http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit\n[phantom]: http://www.phantomjs.org/\n[contribution guide]: http://gruntjs.com/contributing\n[getting started guide]: http://gruntjs.com/getting-started\n[wiki]: http://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/wiki","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"grunt@0.4.0-rc8","dist":{"shasum":"2fafeb3a8dc146ba37430063c346c03b5682efea","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/grunt/-/grunt-0.4.0rc8.tgz"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.70","_npmUser":{"name":"cowboy","email":"cowboy@rj3.net"},"maintainers":[{"name":"cowboy","email":"cowboy@rj3.net"},{"name":"tkellen","email":"tyler@sleekcode.net"}],"directories":{}}},"readme":"# grunt\nGrunt is a command line build tool for JavaScript projects.\n\nAs of now, grunt has the following predefined tasks:\n\n * **concat** - Concatenate files.\n * **lint** - Validate files with [JSHint][jshint].\n * **min** - Minify files with [UglifyJS][uglify].\n * **test** - Run unit tests with [nodeunit][nodeunit].\n * **watch** - Run predefined tasks whenever watched files change.\n\n_(My TODO list includes a \"project scaffolding\" task as well as a \"QUnit headless unit-testing\" task)_\n\nAnd in addition to the predefined tasks, you can define your own.\n\n[issues]: https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/issues\n\n[concat]: https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/lib/grunt/tasks/concat.js\n[lint]: https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/lib/grunt/tasks/lint.js\n[min]: https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/lib/grunt/tasks/min.js\n[test]: https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/lib/grunt/tasks/test.js\n[misc]: https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/lib/grunt/tasks/misc.js\n[tasks]: https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/tree/master/lib/grunt/tasks\n[gruntfile]: https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/grunt.js\n\n[node]: http://nodejs.org/\n[npm]: http://npmjs.org/\n[jshint]: http://www.jshint.com/\n[uglify]: https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/\n[nodeunit]: https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit\n\n## Why does grunt exist?\nDoing all this stuff manually is a total pain, and building all this stuff into a gigantic Makefile / Jakefile / Cakefile / Rakefile / ?akefile that's maintained across all my projects was also becoming a total pain. Since I always found myself performing the same tasks over and over again, for every project, it made sense to build a task-based build tool.\n\nBeing primarily a JavaScript developer, I decided to use [Node.js][node] and [npm][npm] because the dependencies I most care about ([JSHint][jshint] and [UglifyJS][uglify]) were already npm modules. That being said, while Node.js was designed to support highly-concurrent asynchronous-IO-driven web servers, it was clearly NOT designed to make command-line build tools. But none of that matters, because grunt works. Just install it and see.\n\n## Installing grunt\n\n_Grunt is currently in beta. While I'm already using it on multiple projects, it might have a minor issue or two. And things might change before its final release, based on your feedback. Please try it out in a project, and [make suggestions][issues] or [report bugs][issues]!_\n\nGrunt is available as an [npm][npm] module. If you install grunt globally via `npm install -g grunt`, it will be available for use in all of your projects.\n\nOnce grunt has been installed, you can type `grunt --help` at the command line for more information. And if you want to see grunt \"grunt\" itself, cd into grunt's directory and type `grunt` (in Windows, you might need to run it as `grunt.cmd`).\n\n## The config file, aka \"gruntfile\"\nWhen run, grunt looks in the current directory for a file named `grunt.js`, and if not found, continues looking in parent directories until found. The gruntfile is typically placed in the root of your project repository, and is a valid JavaScript file comprised of two parts: [project configuration](#config), and [tasks](#tasks) / [helpers](#helpers).\n\n<div id=\"config\"></div>\n## Project configuration\nEach grunt task relies on configuration information defined in a single `config.init()` call in the gruntfile. Usually, this information is specified in task-named sub-properties of a main configuration object. It's not as complicated as it sounds.\n\nFor example, this simple configuration would define a list of files to be linted when the task \"lint:files\" was run on the command line like this: `grunt lint:files`.\n\n```javascript\nconfig.init({\n  lint: {\n    files: ['lib/*.js', 'test/*.js', 'grunt.js']\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAlso note that because the \"lint\" task is a [basic task](#tasks_basic), you can also run _all_ lint sub-tasks with just `grunt lint`.\n\nYou can store any arbitrary information inside of the configuration object, and as long as it doesn't conflict with a property one of your tasks is using, it will be ignored.\n\n```javascript\nconfig.init({\n  // Generic project information used by some helpers and tasks.\n  meta: {},\n  // Lists of files to be concatenated, used by the \"concat\" task.\n  concat: {},\n  // Lists of files to be minififed with UglifyJS, used by the \"min\" task.\n  min: {},\n  // Lists of files to be unit tested with Nodeunit, used by the \"test\" task.\n  test: {},\n  // Lists of files to be linted with JSHint, used by the \"lint\" task.\n  lint: {},\n  // Global configuration options for JSHint.\n  jshint: {},\n  // Global configuration options for UglifyJS.\n  uglify: {}\n});\n```\n\nTake a look at grunt's own [grunt.js gruntfile][gruntfile] or [javascript-hooker's gruntfile](https://github.com/cowboy/javascript-hooker/blob/master/grunt.js) or [glob-whatev's gruntfile](https://github.com/cowboy/node-glob-whatev/blob/master/grunt.js) for a few examples.\n\n_Note: you don't need to specify configuration settings for tasks that you don't use._\n\n<div id=\"tasks\"></div>\n## Tasks\nTasks are the things you do most often, like [concat][concat], [lint][lint], [min][min] or [test][test] files. Every time grunt is run, one or more tasks must be specified, which tells grunt what you want it to do. Note that if you don't specify a task, but a task named \"default\" has been defined, that task will run (unsurprisingly) by default.\n\n_You should probably create a [\"default\" task][gruntfile] in your gruntfile._\n\nTasks can be created in a few ways.\n\n<div id=\"tasks_alias\"></div>\n### Alias tasks\n\n```javascript\ntask.registerTask(taskName, [description, ] taskList);\n```\n\n_Note that the description is optional. If omitted, a useful description will be added for you automatically._\n\nThe following example defines a task named \"theworks\" that, when run, actually runs the \"lint:files\" \"test:files\" \"concat\" \"min\" tasks, in-order. so instead of typing `grunt lint:files test:files concat min` at the command line, you can just type `grunt theworks`. If this task were named \"default\" instead of \"theworks\" it would be run by default whenever `grunt` was executed without specifying tasks.\n\n```javascript\ntask.registerTask('theworks', 'lint:files test:files concat min');\n```\n\n<div id=\"tasks_basic\"></div>\n### Basic tasks\nA basic task is a task that implicitly iterates over all of its configuration sub-properties if no sub-task is specified. For example, in the following, while `grunt lint:test` or `grunt lint:lib` will lint only those specific files, `grunt lint` will run the \"test\", \"lib\" and \"grunt\" sub-tasks for you, automatically. It's convenient.\n\n```javascript\nconfig.init({\n  lint: {\n    test: ['test/*.js'],\n    lib: ['lib/*.js'],\n    grunt: ['grunt.js']\n  }\n});\n```\n\nWhile it's probably more useful for you to check out the JavaScript source of the [concat][concat], [lint][lint], [min][min] or [test][test] tasks, this is how you'd define a Basic task:\n\n```javascript\ntask.registerBasicTask('log', 'This task logs something.', function(data, name) {\n  // data === the value of the config sub-prop\n  // name === the name of the config sub-prop\n\n  log.writeln(data);\n\n  if (failureOfSomeKind) { return false; }\n  log.writeln('Your success message.');\n});\n```\n\n<div id=\"tasks_custom\"></div>\n### Custom tasks\n\nYou can go crazy with tasks, though. They don't have to be basic.\n\n```javascript\ntask.registerTask('default', 'My \"default\" task description.', function() {\n  log.writeln('Currently running the \"default\" task.');\n});\n```\n\nInside a task, you can run other tasks.\n\n```javascript\ntask.registerTask('foo', 'My \"foo\" task.', function() {\n  // Enqueue \"bar\" and \"baz\" tasks, to run after 'foo' finishes, in-order.\n  task.run('bar baz');\n  // Or:\n  task.run(['bar', 'baz']);\n});\n```\n\nTasks can be asynchronous.\n\n```javascript\ntask.registerTask('async', 'My \"foo\" task.', function() {\n  // Force task into async mode and grab a handle to the \"done\" function.\n  var done = this.async();\n  // Run some sync stuff.\n  log.writeln('Processing task...');\n  // And some async stuff.\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    log.writeln('All done!');\n    done();\n  }, 1000);\n});\n```\n\nTasks can access their own name and arguments.\n\n```javascript\ntask.registerTask('foo', 'My \"foo\" task.', function(a, b) {\n  log.writeln(this.name, a, b);\n});\n\n// Usage:\n// grunt foo foo:bar\n//   logs: \"foo\", undefined, undefined\n//   logs: \"foo\", \"bar\", undefined\n// grunt foo:bar:baz\n//   logs: \"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\"\n```\n\nTasks can fail if any errors were logged.\n\n```javascript\ntask.registerTask('foo', 'My \"foo\" task.', function() {\n  if (someError) {\n    log.error('This is an error message.');\n  }\n\n  // Fail task if errors were logged.\n  if (task.hadErrors()) { return false; }\n\n  log.writeln('This is the success message');\n});\n```\n\nWhen tasks fail, all subsequent tasks will be aborted unless `--force` is specified.\n\n```javascript\ntask.registerTask('foo', 'My \"foo\" task.', function() {\n  // Fail synchronously.\n  return false;\n});\n\ntask.registerTask('bar', 'My \"bar\" task.', function() {\n  var done = this.async();\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    // Fail asynchronously.\n    done(false);\n  }, 1000);\n});\n```\n\nTasks can be dependent on the successful execution of other tasks. Note that `task.requires` won't actually RUN the other task. It'll just check to see that it has run and not failed.\n\n```javascript\ntask.registerTask('foo', 'My \"foo\" task.', function() {\n  return false;\n});\n\ntask.registerTask('bar', 'My \"bar\" task.', function() {\n  // Fail task if \"foo\" task failed or never ran.\n  task.requires('foo');\n  // This code executes if the \"foo\" task ran successfully.\n  log.writeln('Hello, world.');\n});\n\n// Usage:\n// grunt foo bar\n//   doesn't log, because foo failed.\n// grunt bar\n//   doesn't log, because foo never ran.\n```\n\nTasks can fail if required configuration properties don't exist.\n\n```javascript\ntask.registerTask('foo', 'My \"foo\" task.', function() {\n  // Fail task if \"meta.name\" config prop is missing.\n  config.requires('meta.name');\n  // Also fails if \"meta.name\" config prop is missing.\n  config.requires(['meta', 'name']);\n  // Log... conditionally.\n  log.writeln('This will only log if meta.name is defined in the config.');\n});\n```\n\nTasks can access configuration properties.\n\n```javascript\ntask.registerTask('foo', 'My \"foo\" task.', function() {\n  // Log the property value. Returns null if the property is undefined.\n  log.writeln('The meta.name property is: ' + config('meta.name'));\n  // Also logs the property value. Returns null if the property is undefined.\n  log.writeln('The meta.name property is: ' + config(['meta', 'name']));\n});\n```\n\nLook at the [built-in tasks][tasks] for more examples.\n\n## Helpers\nHelpers are just utility functions, exposed through the `task` global variable, so that they can be used by tasks in other files.\n\nIt's not much more complex than this:\n\n```javascript\ntask.registerHelper('foo', function(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n});\n\ntask.helper('foo', 2, 3) // 5\n```\n\nFor example, in the [min][min] task, the majority of the actual minification work is done in an [uglify][min] helper, so that other tasks can utilize that code if they need to.\n\n## Directives\nDirectives are essentially string placeholders for helper functions, specified as values in the [configuration object](#config). It's not as crazy as it sounds.\n\nA good example of directives would be the `<json:package.json>` and `<config:lint.files>` directives in grunt's own [grunt.js gruntfile][gruntfile]. Or the `<banner>` and `<file_strip_banner:lib/hooker.js>` directives in [javascript-hooker's gruntfile](https://github.com/cowboy/javascript-hooker/blob/master/grunt.js).\n\nIn brief, when a directive like `<foo>` is encountered, the `foo` helper is executed, and its return value is used. If `<foo:bar:baz>` is encountered, the `foo` helper is executed, with arguments `\"bar\"` and `\"baz\"` passed in, and its return value is used.\n\nSome of the built-in directives:\n\n* `<config:prop.subprop>` - expand to the prop.subprop config property. Great for DRYing up file lists.\n* `<json:file.json>` - expand to the object parsed from file.json (a valid JSON file).\n* `<banner>` - the string in config property `meta.banner`, parsed via [handlebars][misc].\n* `<banner:prop.subprop>` - same as above, but using a custom config property.\n* `<file_strip_banner:file.js>` - expand to the given file, with any leading /*...*/ banner stripped.\n\nCan you guess what these directives do? They're from grunt's own [grunt.js gruntfile][gruntfile].\n\n```javascript\nconfig.init({\n  pkg: '<json:package.json>',\n  lint: {\n    files: ['grunt.js', 'lib/**/*.js', 'test/**/*.js']\n  },\n  watch: {\n    files: '<config:lint.files>',\n    tasks: 'default'\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Global Variables\nIn an effort to make things easier, there are a lot of global variables.\n\n* `underscore` - [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/)\n* `util` - miscellaneous utilities\n* `task` - the entire task interface\n* `file` - glob expansion, file reading, writing, directory traversing\n* `fail` - more serious than error logging, `fail.warn` and `fail.fatal` will halt everything\n* `config` - reading values from the grunt configuration\n* `option` - reading values from the command-line options\n* `log` - don't use `console.log`, use `log.writeln` instead! [More info on log](#logging).\n* `verbose` - just like `log`, but only logs if `--verbose` was specified. [More info on verbose](#logging).\n\nUnfortunately, I haven't documented everything yet. Fortunately, the source is open and browsable. Have fun!\n\n<div id=\"logging\"></div>\n## Logging\nI wanted grunt to look pretty. As such, there are a LOT of logging methods, and a few useful patterns:\n\nNote, all of the methods that actually log something are chainable.\n\n* `log.write(msg)` - log msg, with no trailing newline\n* `log.writeln(msg)` - log msg, with trailing newline\n* `log.error(msg)` - if msg is omitted, logs ERROR in red, otherwise logs: >> msg, with trailing newline\n* `log.ok(msg)` - if msg is omitted, logs OK in green, otherwise logs: >> msg, with trailing newline\n* `log.subhead(msg)` - logs msg in bold, with trailing newline\n* `log.writeflags(obj, prefix)` - logs a list of obj properties (good for debugging flags)\n* `log.wordlist(arr)` - returns a comma-separated list of array items\n* `log.verbose` - contains all methods of `log` but only logs if `--verbose` was specified.\n* `log.notverbose` - contains all methods of `log` but only logs if `--verbose` wasn't specified.\n* `log.verbose.or` - reference to `log.notverbose`\n* `log.notverbose.or` - reference to `log.verbose`\n\nThere are a few other methods, but you shouldn't use them in your tasks or helpers, so they've been omitted.\n\nA common pattern is to only log when in `--verbose` mode OR if an error occurs, like so:\n\n```javascript\ntask.registerHelper('something', function(arg) {\n  var result;\n  var msg = 'Doing something...';\n  verbose.write(msg);\n  try {\n    result = doSomethingThatThrowsAnExceptionOnError(arg);\n    // Success!\n    verbose.ok();\n    return result;\n  } catch(e) {\n    // Something went wrong.\n    verbose.or.write(msg).error().error(e.message);\n    fail.warn('Something went wrong.', 50);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAn explanation of the above code:\n\n1. `verbose.write(msg);` logs the message (no newline), but only in `--verbose` mode.\n2. `verbose.ok();` logs OK in green, with a newline.\n3. `verbose.or.write(msg).error().error(e.message);` does a few things:\n  1. `verbose.or.write(msg)` logs the message (no newline) if not in `--verbose` mode, and returns the `notverbose` object.\n  2. `.error()` logs ERROR in red, with a newline, and returns the `notverbose` object.\n  3. `.error(e.message);` logs the actual error message (and returns the `notverbose` object).\n4. `fail.warn('Something went wrong.', 50);` logs a warning in bright yellow, existing grunt with exit code 50, unless `--force` was specified.\n\nYou can write crazy logging chains, omg!\n\n<div id=\"exit_codes\"></div>\n## Exit Codes\n\n* `1` - Generic error.\n* `2` - Config file not found.\n* `3` - Generic task failed.\n* `10` - Uglify-JS error.\n* `11` - Banner generation error.\n* `20` - Init error.\n* `61-69` - Nodeunit errors.\n\n<div id=\"examples\"></div>\n## Examples\nIn this example, you don't want to run `grunt lint concat` every time you need to process your code, because \"dist/output.js\" will be linted before it's created!\n\nYou should really do `grunt lint:beforeconcat concat lint:afterconcat`.\n\n```javascript\nconfig.init({\n  // When the \"concat:dist/output.js\" task is run, the specified \"foo.js\" and\n  // \"bar.js\" files will be concatenated in-order and saved to the \"output.js\"\n  // output file. Because the \"concat\" task is a Basic task, when it is run\n  // without an argument, all sub-tasks will automatically be run.\n  concat: {\n    'dist/output.js': ['src/foo.js', 'src/bar.js']\n  },\n  lint: {\n    // When the \"lint:beforeconcat\" task is run, the specified \"foo.js\" and\n    // \"bar.js\" files will be linted with JSHint. The same follows for the\n    // \"lint:afterconcat\" task. Because the \"lint\" task is a Basic task, when\n    // it is run without an argument, all sub-tasks will automatically be run.\n    beforeconcat: ['src/foo.js', 'src/bar.js'],\n    afterconcat: ['dist/output.js']\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAnd to make your workflow easier, create an [Alias Task](#tasks_alias):\n\n```javascript\ntask.registerTask('default', 'lint:beforeconcat concat lint:afterconcat');\n```\n\n_(more examples coming... soon)_\n\n## Contributing\nFork, tweak, and make pull requests.. but you'd better successfully `grunt` it first, or I'm not even looking.\n\n##
