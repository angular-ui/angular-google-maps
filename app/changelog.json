Dramatically improves performance of polygons especially those containing thousands of points. Setting the static attribute to true implies that both the polygon's points are static (do not change) and that the polygon is for display only (i.e. is not editable).  As a result setting static to true overrides the editable attribute.  The performance benefit comes from the fact that the directive does not need to watch for edits from Google Maps and does not need to perform deep watch on every polygon co-ordinate during every Angular digest cycle. (Although a watch is still performed on the path attribute for changes by reference so that the entire polygon can still be changed.)  On a map with multiple polygons with a total of 25000+ coordinates the browser would simply fail without the static atttribute with the static attribute set to true the polygons are displayed almost instantly."},{"sha":"2e0c89d","author":"Nick McCready <nmccready@gmail.com>","date":"Sun Mar 9 22:47:15 2014 -0400","message":"polylines are destroyed correctly"},{"sha":"d53cc61","author":"Nick McCready <nmccready@gmail.com>","date":"Sun Mar 9 12:08:47 2014 -0400","message":"example2 now draws many polylines"},{"sha":"1dbc160","author":"Nick McCready <nmccready@gmail.com>","date":"Sun Mar 9 11:34:19 2014 -0400","message":"logging a polyline child"},{"sha":"d1e4c50","author":"Nick McCready <nmccready@gmail.com>","date":"Sun Mar 9 11:32:22 2014 -0400","message":"adding and removing a polyline to polylines works now"},{"sha":"97d9e65","author":"Nick McCready <nmccready@gmail.com>","date":"Sat Mar 8 17:55:14 2014 -0500","message":"issue #211 Polylines 95% complete currently I can not drag/move"},{"sha":"8bc6c18","author":"Nick McCready <nmccready@gmail.com>","date":"Sat Mar 8 16:24:14 2014 -0500","message":"api.polyline line formatting"},{"sha":"89e3f70","author":"Nick McCready <nmccready@gmail.com>","date":"Sat Mar 8 16:20:06 2014 -0500","message":"polyline directive now uses api pattern w PolylineChild"},{"sha":"563f953","author":"Nick McCready <nmccready@gmail.com>","date":"Sat Mar 8 15:45:17 2014 -0500","message":"breaking apart polyline logic"},{"sha":"81bf359","author":"Nick McCready <nmccready@gmail.com>","date":"Sat Mar 8 15:21:16 2014 -0500","message":"removed dead util code from IMarker  moved it to GmapUtil since isTrue is there"},{"sha":"c5d8895","author":"Nick McCready <nmccready@gmail.com>","date":"Sat Mar 8 15:12:44 2014 -0500","message":"removing unecessary coffeescript which is implicit and explicit returns in js"},{"sha":"4a58de6","author":"Nick McCready <nmccready@gmail.com>","date":"Sat Mar 8 15:07:44 2014 -0500","message":"directives.api pattern ported to map and polyline to eliminate duplicate code which has been put into GmapUtil"},{"sha":"b6777c4","author":"Nick McCready <nmccready@gmail.com>","date":"Sat Mar 8 13:40:18 2014 -0500","message":"Merge branch 'master' into develop -
